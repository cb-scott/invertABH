# Stay or Go
Repository for modeling coral bleaching from symbionts' perspective.
Included here are all scripts used to simulate results and create figures 
for the paper "Should I Stay or Should I Go? Coral bleaching from the symbionts' perspective". Some post-processing of figures 
was completed using PowerPoint (e.g., legend placement), but core results 
can be replicated.

All required data files to replicate this analysis are in "Data", named as 
referenced in the R scripts.
