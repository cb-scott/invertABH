Repository for modeling coral bleaching from symbionts' perspective.
Included here are all scripts used to simulate results and create figures 
for the paper [cite at publication here]. Some post-processing of figures 
was completed using PowerPoint (e.g., legend placement), but core results 
can be replicated.
